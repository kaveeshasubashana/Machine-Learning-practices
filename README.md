# Machine Learning Practice

## Welcome to the **Machine Learning Practice** repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with **machine learning concepts, algorithms, and projects**. Here, I will practice different ML techniques, build models, and explore datasets to strengthen my understanding of this exciting field.

## Contents

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for experiments and projects.
- **Datasets:** Sample datasets used for practice.
- **Scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Learning Goals

Machine learning can be broadly divided into two main types based on the kind of data and the goal of the task:
ðŸ‘‰ Supervised Learning
ðŸ‘‰ Unsupervised Learning

- Understand core machine learning algorithms ( Supervised Learning)like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Neural Networks
-understanding Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - DBSCAN
- Practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- Apply ML concepts to real-world datasets.
- Build simple ML projects for hands-on learning.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-practice.git

2.Navigate to the project folder: 

cd machine-learning-practice

3.Open the Jupyter notebooks or scripts to start learning.
