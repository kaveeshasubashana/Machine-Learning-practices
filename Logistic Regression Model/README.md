Logistic Regression Model — Predict Job Status Based on Age
📘 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a person has a job or not based on their age.
It uses a simple dataset containing two columns:

age → represents a person’s age

job → represents whether the person has a job (1) or not (0)

This project is created as part of a learning exercise in Machine Learning fundamentals.

🧠 What is Logistic Regression?

Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks.
While the name includes “regression,” it is actually used to predict categories or classes, not continuous values.

In this project, we use Logistic Regression to classify whether a person is employed (1) or unemployed (0) based on their age.

The model works by learning patterns from the data and then predicting the probability that a new input (age) belongs to a specific class.
Unlike linear regression, which can predict any number, logistic regression outputs probabilities between 0 and 1, which makes it suitable for classification.

🔍 Key Concepts

Classification Model: Logistic Regression predicts discrete categories (like Yes/No, 1/0).

Probability Output: It estimates the likelihood of belonging to a certain class.

Decision Boundary: It determines a cutoff (often 0.5) to decide between classes.

Applications: Commonly used in spam detection, medical diagnosis, and customer churn prediction.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 26 samples with the following columns:

Column	Description
age	Age of the person
job	Employment status (1 = Has job, 0 = No job)

Example:

age	job
16	0
31	1
40	1
🧩 Steps Involved

Import and explore the dataset.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Evaluate model performance.

🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas → for data handling

Scikit-learn (sklearn) → for Logistic Regression model

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code → for development and testing

🚀 How to Run the Project

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git

🎯 Goal

To understand how Logistic Regression can be used for binary classification problems and to practice training and testing a simple machine learning model.

📊 Expected Output

The model should predict whether a person has a job (1) or does not have a job (0) based on their age, and display prediction results for testing data.
